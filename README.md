# Tofik in an ancient dungeon

In a land where magic has long since given way to the progress of
 of modern devices and technology, on the edge of the mighty 
XeoCity, in a tiny village, lived a cat named
 Tofik. One day, during one of his classic
 escapades from home, he got lost in a desolate, moribund forest
 not far from where he lived. Suddenly, a
 drone patrolling the area, and a confused Tofik hurriedly
 fled from it, unaware that he would soon find himself at the heart of a
 of a mysterious story. He fell into a hole, which turned out to be a gate
 to an ancient, abandoned chamber, like a gateway to a forgotten era.
